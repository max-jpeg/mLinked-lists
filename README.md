# mLinked-lists
linked list program in c++ with helpful sorting and data editing tools.

I created this program to learn about linked lists in my journey of learning data structures and algorithms.

There is documentation in the source files, If you are interested in using this code it is open source as long as you do not claim in as your own :).
If you would like to see any edits/new features let me know.
